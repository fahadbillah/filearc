CodeIgniter is a powerful PHP framework with a very small footprint, 
built for PHP coders who need a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications. 

CodeIgniter is loosely based on the popular Model-View-Controller development pattern. 
While view and controller classes are a necessary part of development under CodeIgniter, 
models are optional for use in building dynamic web sites with PHP


CodeIgniter is most often noted for its speed when compared to other PHP frameworks

CodeIgniter's source code is maintained at GitHub.
